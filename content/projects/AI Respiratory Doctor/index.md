Over 93% Accuracy &#8226; Advanced Powerful AI &#8226; Easy & Simple to Use

This project is a functional full-stack web app that includes features such as login and signup functionality with a database through Flask-Login, beautiful design thanks to [Materialize.css](https://materializecss.com/), an easy to understand backend because of [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), best practices for production servers, and a state-of-the-art X-Ray Classifier powered by [fast.ai](https://docs.fast.ai/). The AI was trained on  over 100,000 anonymized chest x-ray images from more than 30,000 patients ([NIH Dataset](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-center-provides-one-largest-publicly-available-chest-x-ray-datasets-scientific-community)).
