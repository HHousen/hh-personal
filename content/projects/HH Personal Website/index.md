This site was generated using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io) from an [open source theme](https://github.com/HHousen/hugo-resume) via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The theme that this site uses was forked from [Eddie Webb](https://github.com/eddiewebb/hugo-resume) and heavily modified to be more efficient as well as to fit my personal needs. Netlify acts as my CI. If I push out a change to the [hh-personal repo](https://github.com/HHousen/hh-personal) on GitHub then Netlify will automatically trigger and rebuild this website for production.
