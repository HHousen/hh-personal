Will I Have A Snow Day.com (WIHASD) is a website that will **calculate your chance of having a snow day** using an **AI model**. The model has learned what weather conditions cause snow days by inspecting **decades of data**, more than any human could analyze.

Importantly, WIHASD has a mechanism that enables it to **improve its accuracy over time**. When you make a prediction you can sign up to receive an email the day of the predicted snow day. The email will ask **if the model's prediction was correct**. The captured weather data and your label (whether or not you had a snow day) will be added to the database used to train the model, thus giving it more information about the **weather conditions** and your specific **zip code**.
