**For this research project, I was named a [top 300 scholar](https://www.societyforscience.org/regeneron-sts/2021-scholars/) in the [Regeneron Science Talent Search](https://www.societyforscience.org/regeneron-sts/) 2021, the nationâ€™s oldest and most prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors.**

This project contains my current research involving the summarization of classroom lectures using machine learning, computer vision, and NLP. Currently, the project is closed-source and not available to the public because it is research-in-progress and is being actively developed. Once completed the project will be released as open-source under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
