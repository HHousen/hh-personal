"picoCTF is a free computer security game targeted at middle and high school students, created by security experts at Carnegie Mellon University. The game consists of a series of challenges centered around a unique storyline where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, or do whatever it takes to solve the challenge. The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent, legal way to get hands-on experience." â€” PicoCTF.com

During the competition period, which was held between September 27, 2018 and October 11, 2019, I scored 13,900 points. Since then I have completed all the challenges and reached the max score of 34,201 points. All of my writeups (containing solutions and explanations) can be found in the [github repo](https://github.com/HHousen/PicoCTF-2019).

Not every challenge has a corresponding writeup. I did not do any writeups for any of the challenges in the "General Skills" category since they were mostly for beginners. I also left out many of the beginner-level challenges in other categories. All of the most difficult challenges with the fewest solves have a writeup.
