"picoCTF is a free computer security game targeted at middle and high school students, created by security experts at Carnegie Mellon University. The game consists of a series of challenges centered around a unique storyline where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, or do whatever it takes to solve the challenge. The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent, legal way to get hands-on experience." â€” PicoCTF.com

During the competition period, which was held between September 27, 2018 and October 11, 2019, I scored 13,900 points. I am continuing to work on the challenge problems and am adding my writeups to the [github repo](https://github.com/HHousen/PicoCTF-2019) as I go.

The repository contains my solutions (and explanations) to the PicoCTF 2019 competition.
