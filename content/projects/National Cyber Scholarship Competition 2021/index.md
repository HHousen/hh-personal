During the competition period, which was held from April 5th, 2021 12:00PM EST to April 7th, 2021 12:00PM EST, I placed **23rd out of 3,277** (**top 0.7%**) with a score of **6,150 points**. I completed **76% of the challenges** and earned **54% of the available points**. Since then, I have solved every challenge and achieved the maximum score of **11,400 points**.

This CTF allowed me to practice my web exploitation, reverse engineering, networking, cryptography, and binary exploitation skills.

Regarding the **organization**: "Cybersecurity is one of the worldâ€™s fastest growing industries.
