# hh-personal

The hugo configuration for the Hayden Housen personal website.

The website uses the [HHousen/hugo-resume](https://github.com/HHousen/hugo-resume) theme, which is a fork of [eddiewebb/hugo-resume](https://github.com/eddiewebb/hugo-resume) that removes extra bloat (that I don't need), tweaks the design, adds some new components, and improves efficiency/speed.
